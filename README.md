# Fundamentals_of_Computing

This GitHub repository contains my mini projects for Rice University's Fundamentals of Computing Coursera specialization. 

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals

I completed these projects using CodeSkulptor, a web-based Python environment (very similar to Python 2.7). CodeSkulptor was built by Scott Rixner and is based upon CodeMirror and Skulpt.
