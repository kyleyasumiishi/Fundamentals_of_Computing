# Algorithmic Thinking

Algorithmic Thinking is a two-part course offered by Rice University that is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of algorithmic thinking, allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to real-world computational problems.

Part 1 covers algorithmic efficiency and its application to several problems from graph theory. Part 2 covers advanced algorithmic techniques such as divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming.

These courses are part of the Rice University's 7-part <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals">Fundamentals of Computing</a> specialization on Coursera.
